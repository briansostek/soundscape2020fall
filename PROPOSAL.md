For my soundscape project, I want to recreate the sounds of a boardwalk at the beach in New Jersey at dusk. Walking down the boardwalk with my good friends in the early evening is a great memory I have. The story I want to create (which never really happened) is that one of my friends gets lost and his phone is dead. We must ask around to find him, but another challenge that exists is that this is mid-COVID, meaning strangers probably do not want us talking to them. I will create a sense of time by adding sounds that exist during certain times of the day (etc. crickets once the sun goes down). 

Here's my proposed asset list:
- Waves gently crashing (not too loud since boardwalk is distant from the shoreline) (constant)
-music playing on PA system (mostly constant)
-bugs indicating time
-announcements on PA system announcing to stay socially distant, and to wear a mask.
-voice lines will be muffled as if spoken through a mask.
-voice lines of different voices (use roomates?)
-boardwalk creaking (use desk or other wooden furniture in my room)
-seagulls viciously attacking a cup of crabfries dropped on the boardwalk (incidental)
-people talking, laughing, babies crying (background noise, amount will decrease as time gets later)
